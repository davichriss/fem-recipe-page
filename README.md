## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS for styling
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to make use of the CSS custom properties which makes it possible for me to easily reuse certain properties of my design. in the code snippet below, i created custom properties for different clors of the design, and also created some custom properties for font-sizes in my design.


```css
:root {
--fs-1:32px;
--fs-2:28px;
--fs-3:19px;
--fs-base: 16px;
--White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
--Stone100: hsl(30, 54%, 90%);
--Stone150: hsl(30, 18%, 87%);
--Stone600: hsl(30, 10%, 34%);
--Stone900: hsl(24, 5%, 18%);
--Brown800: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
--Rose800: hsl(332, 51%, 32%);
--Rose50: hsl(330, 100%, 98%);

}

```
I also learned how to make use of semantic html tags in my html structure, as seen below with the main and the section tags
```html
<main>
    <section></section>
</main>
```

### Continued development
I need to understand more about the use of media queries in CSS.
I also aalso need to understand more on import fons locally after downloading using css.
### Useful resources
-[w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com)- This website assisted in implementing font import using the @font-face css asset
